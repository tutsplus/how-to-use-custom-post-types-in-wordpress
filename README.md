## Instructor: [Rachel McCollin][instructor url]

Custom post types allow you to extend WordPress's default post with data that is useful for your own website. For example, if you want ot create a porfolio of your web projects, you could create a "project" type to represent a single project. In this course, you'll learn how to do just that!

In this course, you'll learn how to create your own custom post types and display them in single and archive pages in WordPress. You'll learn how to code a plugin that creates a project category and how to display those projects on your main blog, mixed in with normal posts. You'll also learn how to create a template file to render individual files and a template for displaying a project archive page.
